Surfs_Up Business Analysis

Overview:
The Purpose of the Anaylsis is to see if 
an Ice-Cream Shop is a sustainable business in Oahu. 

Anaylsis:
Based on the analysis from Both June and December i have determined:
Based on the statistical overview of the data we see that:

June does have a warmer MAX Temperature than December but the difference was approximately 2 degrees. 
June does also has a warmer AVERAGE temperature but the difference is less than 3 degrees.
The highest Temperature Difference is in the MINIMUM Temperature. June was 8 degrees warmer.

Summary:
Mr. W. Avy although June is warmer than December the overall average temperature
differences are very minimum.
With this data I believe an Ice-Cream Shop in Oahu would be not only sustainable but also profitable. 
I hope you agree with the assesment and look forward to working with you. 
Regards.
